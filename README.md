# Homework3-passgen
This was a project issued by the Ga Tech Coding Bootcamp. The aim of this project was to create a fully functional password generator in which a user could press the generate password button, be given a set of criteria, and based upon the selected criteria a password would be generated and displayed on the page. This is a useful program in that it allows more difficult to crack or guess passwords to be easily generated. These can then be copied and pasted into a password field and saved by the browser or the user.


Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.
